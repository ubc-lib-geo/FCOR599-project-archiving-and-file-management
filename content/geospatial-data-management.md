# What is Geospatial Data Management?

Your data has a lifecycle of use. As it passes through this lifecycle you make decisions about things like when to edit it, where to store it, who to share it with, and how to describe it.

Have you ever thought?

- How should I name my files?
- Where can I store my data?
- What should I keep track of when I make changes?
- How will I explain this to others?

If so, then you're already thinking about your data management practices.

# Data Workflows

Not only does your data transition through it's own lifecycle, it may also be passed along through workflows. An example of a data workflow:

**GIS Analyst ⮕ IT Specialist ⮕ Community Member**

A GIS analyst might create a wildfire urban interface dataset. It's then passed along to an IT specialist to be deposited into a shared repository or data catalog. Then a community volunteer uses the data to influence decisions about a new development.

**Graduate Research Assistant ⮕ Research Cluster ⮕ Funder**

_Can you explain this workflow?_

## Workflows Can Break Down

These workflows have a tendency to break down if essential data management principles are not followed. I'm sure you can think of a time when you acquired data that was unusable, obsolete, or missing. Some examples of things that might break down a data workflow:

- Inadequately described data versions
- Meaningless filenames
- Changes in storage locations

_What else can break down a data workflow?_

# Data Management Plans

Data management plans (DMPs) are documents that outline how one will organize, store, and share your research data. They can be started before the project begins, and continuously modified during the life of the project. DMPs are often necessary for funding proposals and satisfying grant requirements.

### Tools to guide your development of a DMP:

- For Canadian funding agencies such as CIHR, NSERC and SSHRC: [DMP Assistant](https://researchdata.library.ubc.ca/research-data-management/plan/dmp-assistant/)
- For U.S. funding agencies such as NIH and NSF: [DMP Tool](https://researchdata.library.ubc.ca/research-data-management/plan/dmp-tool/)

More information about DMPs can be found at [UBC Library's Research Data Management site](https://researchdata.library.ubc.ca/plan/).
