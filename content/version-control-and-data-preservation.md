# Data Preservation

Data preservation refers to things beyond backing your data up on a hard drive. This is a HUGE topic in libraries as we continually transition to digital data collections that require long-term storage and use.

Data preservation ensures long-term access to and use of data â€“ beyond the limits of media lifetimes. Data preservation topics include procedures regarding file formats, copyright and permissions, persistent storage and geographic location, and metadata.

## Data Preservation - File Formats

Have you ever had to purchase a software or license just to open a file? Have you tried to open a file that was obsolete? Platform independent, character/text based formats tend to be MUCH more flexible in the long run compared with binary, software-specific file formats.

You should decide which file formats are the most reliable and persistent for your data. Prioritize platform-independent, text-based formats, and UTF-8 character encoding when possible.
