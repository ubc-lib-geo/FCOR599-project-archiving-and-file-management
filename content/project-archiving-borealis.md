# FCOR 599 - Depositing your data in UBC Dataverse Collection (@Borealis)

UBC Library provides our researchers with access to three different purpose-built data repositories: [UBC Dataverse Collection, Dryad, and the Federal Research Data Repository (FRDR)](https://researchdata.library.ubc.ca/deposit/). For this course, we going to focus on UBC Dataverse Collection (@Borealis) because this is the repository you will use to deposit your MGEM data, and also this is our preferred and most supported repository.

## Workflow for depositing into UBC Dataverse Collection

Take a look at our one-pager to start with data deposits in [UBC MGEM Collection](https://borealisdata.ca/dataverse/UBC_MGEM)

> [Quick Guide to UBC Dataverse](https://osf.io/sczv5/)

1. Get yourself an [ORCID](https://orcid.org/). This is a way to differentiate you from other researchers with a similar name, and it will help you connect things like grants, research data and publications in one place. It’s also one of the main ways that search engines such as Google or Datacite link your work back to you.

2. Organize your data on your local computer. Create a directory for your data deposit. Create a sub-directory for each main type of data you’re going to deposit. Here are some one-pager instructions to file naming and data organizing - [File naming guidelines](https://osf.io/pfweq) and [File format recommendations](https://osf.io/ena5p). Dataverse automatically unzips your zipped folders. To preserve data structure and file storage hierarchy, we recommend to **double zip** deposited data folders to keep your intended order.

3. Check out our one-page [guidance on creating README files](https://osf.io/aqxw3). You can download our template README file and work from it. README files are essential for data deposits, they explain what the dataset is all about, naming the variables, software used, licenses, data partners, etc. **Note that we will not publish your dataset without an understandable README file.**

4. Think of a title and a description for your dataset. You could probably use the same ones as in your final report. Since your data deposit is geospatial in nature, please add **Geospatial Metadata** from the metadata menu to ensure that it will display on any map based research data interfaces, such as [Geodisy](https://geo.frdr-dfdr.ca/).

5. There are lots of metadata elements in Dataverse but not all of them will apply to your dataset. The more metadata you add, the more comprehensive your dataset will be. For each element, ask yourself if it applies to your data. Hover over the question mark to read the guidance about that element. If it does, try and fill it in. Time spent on your metadata now equals better findability (in Google, Google Data, Summon, etc) and a better chance that someone else will find and use your data in the future.

6. Deposit a PDF of your final report. PDFs follow ISO 32000-1:2008, which means they are not proprietary and are expected to be durable as files for the future. Be consistent in your date formatting as you saw earlier in our one-page guide.

7. When done, click on Submit Data. We will review it and get back to you with more curational suggestions, e.g. README file, file structure, file formats, descriptions of files, data tags, etc.
