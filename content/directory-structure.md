# Directory Structures

You should consider how you want to organize the folders that contain your data and documentation early on. This could be a date-based system, a filetype-based system, a project-based system, or any other predictable system that makes logical sense in the context of your data.

Folders that organize data for you AND for others should be **logical** and **predictable**
